1. **Task - Project initialization** (v0.1.0): New JupyterLab extension `jupyterlab_custom_main_logo_extension` created from official `jupyterlab/extension-template` (Copier v4.5.1) as a frontend-only extension to replace the default JupyterLab main area logo with a custom logo<br>
    **Result**: Scaffolded project with TypeScript source in `src/index.ts`, Python package in `jupyterlab_custom_main_logo_extension/`, GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`, Makefile v1.27 for build automation, and standard JupyterLab extension structure using hatchling build system. Initialized `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with workspace import and project-specific configuration including mandatory bans on automatic versioning, tagging, and publishing. Updated `README.md` with all standardized badges and brief feature description. Initialized git repository with `git init -b main` and created initial import commit with all artefacts including `package.json`
